<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">If</span> you talk of Murphy and
Francis Moore, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the lamplighter who was in
the chair, &lsquo;I mean to say that neither of &rsquo;em ever
had any more to do with the stars than Tom Grig had.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what had <i>he</i> to do with &rsquo;em?&rsquo;
asked the lamplighter who officiated as vice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; replied the other; &lsquo;just
exactly nothing at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say you don&rsquo;t believe in Murphy,
then?&rsquo; demanded the lamplighter who had opened the
discussion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean to say I believe in Tom Grig,&rsquo; replied the
chairman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whether I believe in Murphy, or not, is a
matter between me and my conscience; and whether Murphy believes
in himself, or not, is a matter between him and his
conscience.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I drink your healths.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lamplighter who did the company this honour, was seated in
the chimney-corner of a certain tavern, which has been, time out
of mind, the Lamplighters&rsquo; House of Call.&nbsp; He sat in
the midst of a circle of lamplighters, and was the cacique, or
chief of the tribe.</p>
<p>If any of our readers have had the good fortune to behold a
lamplighter&rsquo;s funeral, they will not be surprised to learn
that lamplighters are a strange and primitive people; that they
rigidly adhere to old ceremonies and customs which have been
handed down among them from father to son since the first public
lamp was lighted out of doors; that they intermarry, and betroth
their children in infancy; that they enter into no plots or
conspiracies (for who ever heard of a traitorous lamplighter?);
that they commit no crimes against the laws of their country
(there being no instance of a murderous or burglarious
lamplighter); that they are, in short, notwithstanding their
apparently volatile and restless character, a highly moral and
reflective people: having among themselves as many traditional
observances as the Jews, and being, as a body, if not as old as
the hills, at least as old as the streets.&nbsp; It is an article
of their creed that the first faint glimmering of true
civilisation shone in the first street-light maintained at the
public expense.&nbsp; They trace their existence and high
position in the public esteem, in a direct line to the heathen
mythology; and hold that the history of Prometheus himself is but
a pleasant fable, whereof the true hero is a lamplighter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said the lamplighter in the chair,
&lsquo;I drink your healths.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And perhaps, Sir,&rsquo; said the vice, holding up his
glass, and rising a little way off his seat and sitting down
again, in token that he recognised and returned the compliment,
&lsquo;perhaps you will add to that condescension by telling us
who Tom Grig was, and how he came to be connected in your mind
with Francis Moore, Physician.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear, hear, hear!&rsquo; cried the lamplighters
generally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom Grig, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the chairman,
&lsquo;was one of us; and it happened to him, as it don&rsquo;t
often happen to a public character in our line, that he had his
what-you-may-call-it cast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His head?&rsquo; said the vice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the chairman, &lsquo;not his
head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His face, perhaps?&rsquo; said the vice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, not his face.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;His
legs?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, not his legs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor yet
his arms, nor his hands, nor his feet, nor his chest, all of
which were severally suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His nativity, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; said the chairman, awakening
from his thoughtful attitude at the suggestion.&nbsp; &lsquo;His
nativity.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what Tom had cast,
gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In plaster?&rsquo; asked the vice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know how it&rsquo;s done,&rsquo;
returned the chairman.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I suppose it
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there he stopped as if that were all he had to say;
whereupon there arose a murmur among the company, which at length
resolved itself into a request, conveyed through the vice, that
he would go on.&nbsp; This being exactly what the chairman
wanted, he mused for a little time, performed that agreeable
ceremony which is popularly termed wetting one&rsquo;s whistle,
and went on thus:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom Grig, gentlemen, was, as I have said, one of us;
and I may go further, and say he was an ornament to us, and such
a one as only the good old times of oil and cotton could have
produced.&nbsp; Tom&rsquo;s family, gentlemen, were all
lamplighters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the ladies, I hope?&rsquo; asked the vice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They had talent enough for it, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined the
chairman, &lsquo;and would have been, but for the prejudices of
society.&nbsp; Let women have their rights, Sir, and the females
of Tom&rsquo;s family would have been every one of &rsquo;em in
office.&nbsp; But that emancipation hasn&rsquo;t come yet, and
hadn&rsquo;t then, and consequently they confined themselves to
the bosoms of their families, cooked the dinners, mended the
clothes, minded the children, comforted their husbands, and
attended to the house-keeping generally.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a hard
thing upon the women, gentlemen, that they are limited to such a
sphere of action as this; very hard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I happen to know all about Tom, gentlemen, from the
circumstance of his uncle by his mother&rsquo;s side, having been
my particular friend.&nbsp; His (that&rsquo;s Tom&rsquo;s
uncle&rsquo;s) fate was a melancholy one.&nbsp; Gas was the death
of him.&nbsp; When it was first talked of, he laughed.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t angry; he laughed at the credulity of human
nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;They might as well talk,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;of laying on an everlasting succession of
glow-worms;&rdquo; and then he laughed again, partly at his joke,
and partly at poor humanity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In course of time, however, the thing got ground, the
experiment was made, and they lighted up Pall Mall.&nbsp;
Tom&rsquo;s uncle went to see it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard that he
fell off his ladder fourteen times that night, from weakness, and
that he would certainly have gone on falling till he killed
himself, if his last tumble hadn&rsquo;t been into a wheelbarrow
which was going his way, and humanely took him home.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I foresee in this,&rdquo; says Tom&rsquo;s uncle faintly,
and taking to his bed as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;I foresee in
this,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the breaking up of our
profession.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no more going the rounds to trim
by daylight, no more dribbling down of the oil on the hats and
bonnets of ladies and gentlemen when one feels in spirits.&nbsp;
Any low fellow can light a gas-lamp.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s all
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this state of mind, he petitioned the
government for&mdash;I want a word again, gentlemen&mdash;what do
you call that which they give to people when it&rsquo;s found
out, at last, that they&rsquo;ve never been of any use, and have
been paid too much for doing nothing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Compensation?&rsquo; suggested the vice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; said the chairman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Compensation.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t give it him, though,
and then he got very fond of his country all at once, and went
about saying that gas was a death-blow to his native land, and
that it was a plot of the radicals to ruin the country and
destroy the oil and cotton trade for ever, and that the whales
would go and kill themselves privately, out of sheer spite and
vexation at not being caught.&nbsp; At last he got right-down
cracked; called his tobacco-pipe a gas-pipe; thought his tears
were lamp-oil; and went on with all manner of nonsense of that
sort, till one night he hung himself on a lamp-iron in Saint
Martin&rsquo;s Lane, and there was an end of <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom loved him, gentlemen, but he survived it.&nbsp; He
shed a tear over his grave, got very drunk, spoke a funeral
oration that night in the watch-house, and was fined five
shillings for it, in the morning.&nbsp; Some men are none the
worse for this sort of thing.&nbsp; Tom was one of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; He went that very afternoon on a new beat: as
clear in his head, and as free from fever as Father Mathew
himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom&rsquo;s new beat, gentlemen, was&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t exactly say where, for that he&rsquo;d never tell;
but I know it was in a quiet part of town, where there were some
queer old houses.&nbsp; I have always had it in my head that it
must have been somewhere near Canonbury Tower in Islington, but
that&rsquo;s a matter of opinion.&nbsp; Wherever it was, he went
upon it, with a bran-new ladder, a white hat, a brown holland
jacket and trousers, a blue neck-kerchief, and a sprig of
full-blown double wall-flower in his button-hole.&nbsp; Tom was
always genteel in his appearance, and I have heard from the best
judges, that if he had left his ladder at home that afternoon,
you might have took him for a lord.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was always merry, was Tom, and such a singer, that
if there was any encouragement for native talent, he&rsquo;d have
been at the opera.&nbsp; He was on his ladder, lighting his first
lamp, and singing to himself in a manner more easily to be
conceived than described, when he hears the clock strike five,
and suddenly sees an old gentleman with a telescope in his hand,
throw up a window and look at him very hard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom didn&rsquo;t know what could be passing in this old
gentleman&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He thought it likely enough that he
might be saying within himself, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a new
lamplighter&mdash;a good-looking young fellow&mdash;shall I stand
something to drink?&rdquo;&nbsp; Thinking this possible, he keeps
quite still, pretending to be very particular about the wick, and
looks at the old gentleman sideways, seeming to take no notice of
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen, he was one of the strangest and most
mysterious-looking files that ever Tom clapped his eyes on.&nbsp;
He was dressed all slovenly and untidy, in a great gown of a kind
of bed-furniture pattern, with a cap of the same on his head; and
a long old flapped waistcoat; with no braces, no strings, very
few buttons&mdash;in short, with hardly any of those artificial
contrivances that hold society together.&nbsp; Tom knew by these
signs, and by his not being shaved, and by his not being
over-clean, and by a sort of wisdom not quite awake, in his face,
that he was a scientific old gentleman.&nbsp; He often told me
that if he could have conceived the possibility of the whole
Royal Society being boiled down into one man, he should have said
the old gentleman&rsquo;s body was that Body.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old gentleman claps the telescope to his eye, looks
all round, sees nobody else in sight, stares at Tom again, and
cries out very loud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hal-loa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Halloa, Sir,&rdquo; says Tom from the ladder;
&ldquo;and halloa again, if you come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an extraordinary fulfilment,&rdquo;
says the old gentleman, &ldquo;of a prediction of the
planets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Is there?&rdquo; says Tom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; says the old gentleman,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says Tom, &ldquo;I have not that
honour; but I shall be happy to drink your health,
notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I read,&rdquo; cries the old gentleman, without
taking any notice of this politeness on Tom&rsquo;s
part&mdash;&ldquo;I read what&rsquo;s going to happen, in the
stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom thanked him for the information, and begged to know
if anything particular was going to happen in the stars, in the
course of a week or so; but the old gentleman, correcting him,
explained that he read in the stars what was going to happen on
dry land, and that he was acquainted with all the celestial
bodies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;re all well, Sir,&rdquo; says
Tom,&mdash;&ldquo;everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cries the old gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have consulted the book of Fate with rare and wonderful
success.&nbsp; I am versed in the great sciences of astrology and
astronomy.&nbsp; In my house here, I have every description of
apparatus for observing the course and motion of the
planets.&nbsp; Six months ago, I derived from this source, the
knowledge that precisely as the clock struck five this afternoon
a stranger would present himself&mdash;the destined husband of my
young and lovely niece&mdash;in reality of illustrious and high
descent, but whose birth would be enveloped in uncertainty and
mystery.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me yours isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says
the old gentleman, who was in such a hurry to speak that he
couldn&rsquo;t get the words out fast enough, &ldquo;for I know
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen, Tom was so astonished when he heard him say
this, that he could hardly keep his footing on the ladder, and
found it necessary to hold on by the lamp-post.&nbsp; There
<i>was</i> a mystery about his birth.&nbsp; His mother had always
admitted it.&nbsp; Tom had never known who was his father, and
some people had gone so far as to say that even <i>she</i> was in
doubt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While he was in this state of amazement, the old
gentleman leaves the window, bursts out of the house-door, shakes
the ladder, and Tom, like a ripe pumpkin, comes sliding down into
his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Let me embrace you,&rdquo; he says, folding his
arms about him, and nearly lighting up his old bed-furniture gown
at Tom&rsquo;s link.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a man of noble
aspect.&nbsp; Everything combines to prove the accuracy of my
observations.&nbsp; You have had mysterious promptings within
you,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I know you have had whisperings of
greatness, eh?&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; says Tom&mdash;Tom was
one of those who can persuade themselves to anything they
like&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought I wasn&rsquo;t the
small beer I was taken for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; cries the old gentleman,
hugging him again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in.&nbsp; My niece awaits
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Is the young lady tolerable good-looking,
Sir?&rdquo; says Tom, hanging fire rather, as he thought of her
playing the piano, and knowing French, and being up to all manner
of accomplishments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; cries the old
gentleman, who was in such a terrible bustle that he was all in a
perspiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has a graceful carriage, an
exquisite shape, a sweet voice, a countenance beaming with
animation and expression; and the eye,&rdquo; he says, rubbing
his hands, &ldquo;of a startled fawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom supposed this might mean, what was called among his
circle of acquaintance, &ldquo;a game eye;&rdquo; and, with a
view to this defect, inquired whether the young lady had any
cash.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She has five thousand pounds,&rdquo; cries the
old gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what of that? what of that?&nbsp;
A word in your ear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in search of the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone.&nbsp; I have very nearly found
it&mdash;not quite.&nbsp; It turns everything to gold;
that&rsquo;s its property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom naturally thought it must have a deal of property;
and said that when the old gentleman did get it, he hoped
he&rsquo;d be careful to keep it in the family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of
course.&nbsp; Five thousand pounds!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s five
thousand pounds to us?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s five million?&rdquo; he
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s five thousand million?&nbsp;
Money will be nothing to us.&nbsp; We shall never be able to
spend it fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try what we can do, Sir,&rdquo; says
Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; says the old gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Grig,&rdquo; says Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old gentleman embraced him again, very tight; and
without speaking another word, dragged him into the house in such
an excited manner, that it was as much as Tom could do to take
his link and ladder with him, and put them down in the
passage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen, if Tom hadn&rsquo;t been always remarkable
for his love of truth, I think you would still have believed him
when he said that all this was like a dream.&nbsp; There is no
better way for a man to find out whether he is really asleep or
awake, than calling for something to eat.&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s in
a dream, gentlemen, he&rsquo;ll find something wanting in
flavour, depend upon it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom explained his doubts to the old gentleman, and said
that if there was any cold meat in the house, it would ease his
mind very much to test himself at once.&nbsp; The old gentleman
ordered up a venison pie, a small ham, and a bottle of very old
Madeira.&nbsp; At the first mouthful of pie and the first glass
of wine, Tom smacks his lips and cries out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
awake&mdash;wide awake;&rdquo; and to prove that he was so,
gentlemen, he made an end of &rsquo;em both.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Tom had finished his meal (which he never spoke of
afterwards without tears in his eyes), the old gentleman hugs him
again, and says, &ldquo;Noble stranger! let us visit my young and
lovely niece.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tom, who was a little elevated with
the wine, replies, &ldquo;The noble stranger is
agreeable!&rdquo;&nbsp; At which words the old gentleman took him
by the hand, and led him to the parlour; crying as he opened the
door, &ldquo;Here is Mr. Grig, the favourite of the
planets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not attempt a description of female beauty,
gentlemen, for every one of us has a model of his own that suits
his own taste best.&nbsp; In this parlour that I&rsquo;m speaking
of, there were two young ladies; and if every gentleman present,
will imagine two models of his own in their places, and will be
kind enough to polish &rsquo;em up to the very highest pitch of
perfection, he will then have a faint conception of their
uncommon radiance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides these two young ladies, there was their
waiting-woman, that under any other circumstances Tom would have
looked upon as a Venus; and besides her, there was a tall, thin,
dismal-faced young gentleman, half man and half boy, dressed in a
childish suit of clothes very much too short in the legs and
arms; and looking, according to Tom&rsquo;s comparison, like one
of the wax juveniles from a tailor&rsquo;s door, grown up and run
to seed.&nbsp; Now, this youngster stamped his foot upon the
ground and looked very fierce at Tom, and Tom looked fierce at
him&mdash;for to tell the truth, gentlemen, Tom more than half
suspected that when they entered the room he was kissing one of
the young ladies; and for anything Tom knew, you observe, it
might be <i>his</i> young lady&mdash;which was not pleasant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says Tom, &ldquo;before we proceed
any further, will you have the goodness to inform me who this
young Salamander&rdquo;&mdash;Tom called him that for
aggravation, you perceive, gentlemen&mdash;&ldquo;who this young
Salamander may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That, Mr. Grig,&rdquo; says the old gentleman,
&ldquo;is my little boy.&nbsp; He was christened Galileo Isaac
Newton Flamstead.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
mere child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And a very fine child too,&rdquo; says
Tom&mdash;still aggravating, you&rsquo;ll observe&mdash;&ldquo;of
his age, and as good as fine, I have no doubt.&nbsp; How do you
do, my man?&rdquo; with which kind and patronising expressions,
Tom reached up to pat him on the head, and quoted two lines about
little boys, from Doctor Watts&rsquo;s Hymns, which he had learnt
at a Sunday School.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was very easy to see, gentlemen, by this
youngster&rsquo;s frowning and by the waiting-maid&rsquo;s
tossing her head and turning up her nose, and by the young ladies
turning their backs and talking together at the other end of the
room, that nobody but the old gentleman took very kindly to the
noble stranger.&nbsp; Indeed, Tom plainly heard the waiting-woman
say of her master, that so far from being able to read the stars
as he pretended, she didn&rsquo;t believe he knew his letters in
&rsquo;em, or at best that he had got further than words in one
syllable; but Tom, not minding this (for he was in spirits after
the Madeira), looks with an agreeable air towards the young
ladies, and, kissing his hand to both, says to the old gentleman,
&ldquo;Which is which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says the old gentleman, leading out
the handsomest, if one of &rsquo;em could possibly be said to be
handsomer than the other&mdash;&ldquo;this is my niece, Miss
Fanny Barker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll permit me, Miss,&rdquo; says
Tom, &ldquo;being a noble stranger and a favourite of the
planets, I will conduct myself as such.&rdquo;&nbsp; With these
words, he kisses the young lady in a very affable way, turns to
the old gentleman, slaps him on the back, and says,
&ldquo;When&rsquo;s it to come off, my buck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The young lady coloured so deep, and her lip trembled
so much, gentlemen, that Tom really thought she was going to
cry.&nbsp; But she kept her feelings down, and turning to the old
gentleman, says, &ldquo;Dear uncle, though you have the absolute
disposal of my hand and fortune, and though you mean well in
disposing of &rsquo;em thus, I ask you whether you don&rsquo;t
think this is a mistake?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think, dear
uncle,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;that the stars must be in
error?&nbsp; Is it not possible that the comet may have put
&rsquo;em out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The stars,&rdquo; says the old gentleman,
&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t make a mistake if they tried.&nbsp;
Emma,&rdquo; he says to the other young lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The same day that makes your cousin Mrs. Grig
will unite you to the gifted Mooney.&nbsp; No
remonstrance&mdash;no tears.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Grig, let me conduct
you to that hallowed ground, that philosophical retreat, where my
friend and partner, the gifted Mooney of whom I have just now
spoken, is even now pursuing those discoveries which shall enrich
us with the precious metal, and make us masters of the
world.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Grig,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;With all my heart, Sir,&rdquo; replies Tom;
&ldquo;and luck to the gifted Mooney, say I&mdash;not so much on
his account as for our worthy selves!&rdquo;&nbsp; With this
sentiment, Tom kissed his hand to the ladies again, and followed
him out; having the gratification to perceive, as he looked back,
that they were all hanging on by the arms and legs of Galileo
Isaac Newton Flamstead, to prevent him from following the noble
stranger, and tearing him to pieces.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen, Tom&rsquo;s father-in-law that was to be,
took him by the hand, and having lighted a little lamp, led him
across a paved court-yard at the back of the house, into a very
large, dark, gloomy room: filled with all manner of bottles,
globes, books, telescopes, crocodiles, alligators, and other
scientific instruments of every kind.&nbsp; In the centre of this
room was a stove or furnace, with what Tom called a pot, but
which in my opinion was a crucible, in full boil.&nbsp; In one
corner was a sort of ladder leading through the roof; and up this
ladder the old gentleman pointed, as he said in a whisper:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The observatory.&nbsp; Mr. Mooney is even now
watching for the precise time at which we are to come into all
the riches of the earth.&nbsp; It will be necessary for he and I,
alone in that silent place, to cast your nativity before the hour
arrives.&nbsp; Put the day and minute of your birth on this piece
of paper, and leave the rest to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; says Tom,
doing as he was told and giving him back the paper, &ldquo;that
I&rsquo;m to wait here long, do you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a precious
dismal place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; says the old gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hallowed ground.&nbsp; Farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; says Tom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a hurry you&rsquo;re in!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s in that
large bottle yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a child with three heads,&rdquo; says
the old gentleman; &ldquo;and everything else in
proportion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you throw him away?&rdquo; says
Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you keep such unpleasant things here
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Throw him away!&rdquo; cries the old
gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;We use him constantly in astrology.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it,&rdquo; says
Tom, &ldquo;from his appearance.&nbsp; <i>Must</i> you go, I
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old gentleman makes him no answer, but climbs up
the ladder in a greater bustle than ever.&nbsp; Tom looked after
his legs till there was nothing of him left, and then sat down to
wait; feeling (so he used to say) as comfortable as if he was
going to be made a freemason, and they were heating the
pokers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom waited so long, gentlemen, that he began to think
it must be getting on for midnight at least, and felt more dismal
and lonely than ever he had done in all his life.&nbsp; He tried
every means of whiling away the time, but it never had seemed to
move so slow.&nbsp; First, he took a nearer view of the child
with three heads, and thought what a comfort it must have been to
his parents.&nbsp; Then he looked up a long telescope which was
pointed out of the window, but saw nothing particular, in
consequence of the stopper being on at the other end.&nbsp; Then
he came to a skeleton in a glass case, labelled, &ldquo;Skeleton
of a Gentleman&mdash;prepared by Mr. Mooney,&rdquo;&mdash;which
made him hope that Mr. Mooney might not be in the habit of
preparing gentlemen that way without their own consent.&nbsp; A
hundred times, at least, he looked into the pot where they were
boiling the philosopher&rsquo;s stone down to the proper
consistency, and wondered whether it was nearly done.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When it is,&rdquo; thinks Tom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send out
for six-penn&rsquo;orth of sprats, and turn &rsquo;em into gold
fish for a first experiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides which, he made
up his mind, gentlemen, to have a country-house and a park; and
to plant a bit of it with a double row of gas-lamps a mile long,
and go out every night with a French-polished mahogany ladder,
and two servants in livery behind him, to light &rsquo;em for his
own pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At length and at last, the old gentleman&rsquo;s legs
appeared upon the steps leading through the roof, and he came
slowly down: bringing along with him, the gifted Mooney.&nbsp;
This Mooney, gentlemen, was even more scientific in appearance
than his friend; and had, as Tom often declared upon his word and
honour, the dirtiest face we can possibly know of, in this
imperfect state of existence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen, you are all aware that if a scientific man
isn&rsquo;t absent in his mind, he&rsquo;s of no good at
all.&nbsp; Mr. Mooney was so absent, that when the old gentleman
said to him, &ldquo;Shake hands with Mr. Grig,&rdquo; he put out
his leg.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a mind, Mr. Grig!&rdquo; cries
the old gentleman in a rapture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
philosophy!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s rumination!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
disturb him,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for this is
amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom had no wish to disturb him, having nothing
particular to say; but he was so uncommonly amazing, that the old
gentleman got impatient, and determined to give him an electric
shock to bring him to&mdash;&ldquo;for you must know, Mr.
Grig,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that we always keep a strongly
charged battery, ready for that purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; These means
being resorted to, gentlemen, the gifted Mooney revived with a
loud roar, and he no sooner came to himself than both he and the
old gentleman looked at Tom with compassion, and shed tears
abundantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; says the old gentleman to
the Gifted, &ldquo;prepare him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; cries Tom, falling back,
&ldquo;none of that, you know.&nbsp; No preparing by Mr. Mooney
if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replies the old gentleman,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand us.&nbsp; My friend, inform him
of his fate.&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Gifted mustered up his voice, after many efforts,
and informed Tom that his nativity had been carefully cast, and
he would expire at exactly thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven
seconds, and five-sixths of a second past nine o&rsquo;clock,
a.m., on that day two months.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen, I leave you to judge what were Tom&rsquo;s
feelings at this announcement, on the eve of matrimony and
endless riches.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he says in a
trembling voice, &ldquo;there must be a mistake in the working of
that sum.&nbsp; Will you do me the favour to cast it up
again?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There is no mistake,&rdquo; replies
the old gentleman, &ldquo;it is confirmed by Francis Moore,
Physician.&nbsp; Here is the prediction for to-morrow two
months.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he showed him the page, where sure
enough were these words&mdash;&ldquo;The decease of a great
person may be looked for, about this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Which,&rdquo; says the old gentleman, &ldquo;is
clearly you, Mr. Grig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Too clearly,&rdquo; cries Tom, sinking into a
chair, and giving one hand to the old gentleman, and one to the
Gifted.&nbsp; &ldquo;The orb of day has set on Thomas Grig for
ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this affecting remark, the Gifted shed tears again,
and the other two mingled their tears with his, in a
kind&mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;of Mooney and
Co.&rsquo;s entire.&nbsp; But the old gentleman recovering first,
observed that this was only a reason for hastening the marriage,
in order that Tom&rsquo;s distinguished race might be transmitted
to posterity; and requesting the Gifted to console Mr. Grig
during his temporary absence, he withdrew to settle the
preliminaries with his niece immediately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, gentlemen, a very extraordinary and remarkable
occurrence took place; for as Tom sat in a melancholy way in one
chair, and the Gifted sat in a melancholy way in another, a
couple of doors were thrown violently open, the two young ladies
rushed in, and one knelt down in a loving attitude at Tom&rsquo;s
feet, and the other at the Gifted&rsquo;s.&nbsp; So far, perhaps,
as Tom was concerned&mdash;as he used to say&mdash;you will say
there was nothing strange in this: but you will be of a different
opinion when you understand that Tom&rsquo;s young lady was
kneeling to the Gifted, and the Gifted&rsquo;s young lady was
kneeling to Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Halloa! stop a minute!&rdquo; cries Tom;
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a mistake.&nbsp; I need condoling with by
sympathising woman, under my afflicting circumstances; but
we&rsquo;re out in the figure.&nbsp; Change partners,
Mooney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Monster!&rdquo; cries Tom&rsquo;s young lady,
clinging to the Gifted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Miss!&rdquo; says Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
<i>that</i> your manners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I abjure thee!&rdquo; cries Tom&rsquo;s young
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I renounce thee.&nbsp; I never will be
thine.&nbsp; Thou,&rdquo; she says to the Gifted, &ldquo;art the
object of my first and all-engrossing passion.&nbsp; Wrapt in thy
sublime visions, thou hast not perceived my love; but, driven to
despair, I now shake off the woman and avow it.&nbsp; Oh, cruel,
cruel man!&rdquo;&nbsp; With which reproach she laid her head
upon the Gifted&rsquo;s breast, and put her arms about him in the
tenderest manner possible, gentlemen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; says the other young lady, in a
sort of ecstasy, that made Tom start&mdash;&ldquo;I hereby abjure
my chosen husband too.&nbsp; Hear me, Goblin!&rdquo;&mdash;this
was to the Gifted&mdash;&ldquo;Hear me!&nbsp; I hold thee in the
deepest detestation.&nbsp; The maddening interview of this one
night has filled my soul with love&mdash;but not for thee.&nbsp;
It is for thee, for thee, young man,&rdquo; she cries to
Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;As Monk Lewis finely observes, Thomas, Thomas,
I am thine, Thomas, Thomas, thou art mine: thine for ever, mine
for ever!&rdquo; with which words, she became very tender
likewise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom and the Gifted, gentlemen, as you may believe,
looked at each other in a very awkward manner, and with thoughts
not at all complimentary to the two young ladies.&nbsp; As to the
Gifted, I have heard Tom say often, that he was certain he was in
a fit, and had it inwardly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Speak to me!&nbsp; Oh, speak to me!&rdquo; cries
Tom&rsquo;s young lady to the Gifted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to speak to anybody,&rdquo;
he says, finding his voice at last, and trying to push her
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I had better go.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m frightened,&rdquo; he says, looking
about as if he had lost something.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not one look of love!&rdquo; she cries.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hear me while I declare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to look a look of
love,&rdquo; he says, all in a maze.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
declare anything.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to hear
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cries the old
gentleman (who it seems had been listening).&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t hear her.&nbsp; Emma
shall marry you to-morrow, my friend, whether she likes it or
not, and <i>she</i> shall marry Mr. Grig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen, these words were no sooner out of his mouth
than Galileo Isaac Newton Flamstead (who it seems had been
listening too) darts in, and spinning round and round, like a
young giant&rsquo;s top, cries, &ldquo;Let her.&nbsp; Let
her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fierce; I&rsquo;m furious.&nbsp; I give her
leave.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never marry anybody after
this&mdash;never.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t safe.&nbsp; She is the
falsest of the false,&rdquo; he cries, tearing his hair and
gnashing his teeth; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll live and die a
bachelor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The little boy,&rdquo; observed the Gifted
gravely, &ldquo;albeit of tender years, has spoken wisdom.&nbsp;
I have been led to the contemplation of woman-kind, and will not
adventure on the troubled waters of matrimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What!&rdquo; says the old gentleman, &ldquo;not
marry my daughter!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you, Mooney?&nbsp; Not if I
make her?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Mooney, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And if anybody asks me any more, I&rsquo;ll
run away, and never come back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mr. Grig,&rdquo; says the old gentleman,
&ldquo;the stars must be obeyed.&nbsp; You have not changed your
mind because of a little girlish folly&mdash;eh, Mr.
Grig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom, gentlemen, had had his eyes about him, and was
pretty sure that all this was a device and trick of the
waiting-maid, to put him off his inclination.&nbsp; He had seen
her hiding and skipping about the two doors, and had observed
that a very little whispering from her pacified the Salamander
directly.&nbsp; &ldquo;So,&rdquo; thinks Tom, &ldquo;this is a
plot&mdash;but it won&rsquo;t fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Eh, Mr. Grig?&rdquo; says the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, Sir,&rdquo; says Tom, pointing to the
crucible, &ldquo;if the soup&rsquo;s nearly
ready&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Another hour beholds the consummation of our
labours,&rdquo; returned the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; says Tom, with a mournful
air.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only for two months, but I may as
well be the richest man in the world even for that time.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not particular, I&rsquo;ll take her, Sir.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old gentleman was in a rapture to find Tom still in
the same mind, and drawing the young lady towards him by little
and little, was joining their hands by main force, when all of a
sudden, gentlemen, the crucible blows up, with a great crash;
everybody screams; the room is filled with smoke; and Tom, not
knowing what may happen next, throws himself into a Fancy
attitude, and says, &ldquo;Come on, if you&rsquo;re a man!&rdquo;
without addressing himself to anybody in particular.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The labours of fifteen years!&rdquo; says the
old gentleman, clasping his hands and looking down upon the
Gifted, who was saving the pieces, &ldquo;are destroyed in an
instant!&rdquo;&mdash;And I am told, gentlemen, by-the-bye, that
this same philosopher&rsquo;s stone would have been discovered a
hundred times at least, to speak within bounds, if it
wasn&rsquo;t for the one unfortunate circumstance that the
apparatus always blows up, when it&rsquo;s on the very point of
succeeding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom turns pale when he hears the old gentleman
expressing himself to this unpleasant effect, and stammers out
that if it&rsquo;s quite agreeable to all parties, he would like
to know exactly what has happened, and what change has really
taken place in the prospects of that company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We have failed for the present, Mr. Grig,&rdquo;
says the old gentleman, wiping his forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
regret it the more, because I have in fact invested my
niece&rsquo;s five thousand pounds in this glorious
speculation.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t be cast down,&rdquo; he says,
anxiously&mdash;&ldquo;in another fifteen years, Mr.
Grig&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cries Tom, letting the young lady&rsquo;s
hand fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were the stars very positive about this
union, Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; says the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear it,&rdquo; Tom makes
answer, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s no go, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No what!&rdquo; cries the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Go, Sir,&rdquo; says Tom, fiercely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I forbid the banns.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with these
words&mdash;which are the very words he used&mdash;he sat himself
down in a chair, and, laying his head upon the table, thought
with a secret grief of what was to come to pass on that day two
months.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom always said, gentlemen, that that waiting-maid was
the artfullest minx he had ever seen; and he left it in writing
in this country when he went to colonize abroad, that he was
certain in his own mind she and the Salamander had blown up the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone on purpose, and to cut him out of his
property.&nbsp; I believe Tom was in the right, gentlemen; but
whether or no, she comes forward at this point, and says,
&ldquo;May I speak, Sir?&rdquo; and the old gentleman answering,
&ldquo;Yes, you may,&rdquo; she goes on to say that &ldquo;the
stars are no doubt quite right in every respect, but Tom is not
the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
remember, Sir, that when the clock struck five this afternoon,
you gave Master Galileo a rap on the head with your telescope,
and told him to get out of the way?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I
do,&rdquo; says the old gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; says
the waiting-maid, &ldquo;I say he&rsquo;s the man, and the
prophecy is fulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old gentleman staggers at
this, as if somebody had hit him a blow on the chest, and cries,
&ldquo;He! why he&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon that,
gentlemen, the Salamander cries out that he&rsquo;ll be
twenty-one next Lady-day; and complains that his father has
always been so busy with the sun round which the earth revolves,
that he has never taken any notice of the son that revolves round
him; and that he hasn&rsquo;t had a new suit of clothes since he
was fourteen; and that he wasn&rsquo;t even taken out of nankeen
frocks and trousers till he was quite unpleasant in &rsquo;em;
and touches on a good many more family matters to the same
purpose.&nbsp; To make short of a long story, gentlemen, they all
talk together, and cry together, and remind the old gentleman
that as to the noble family, his own grandfather would have been
lord mayor if he hadn&rsquo;t died at a dinner the year before;
and they show him by all kinds of arguments that if the cousins
are married, the prediction comes true every way.&nbsp; At last,
the old gentleman being quite convinced, gives in; and joins
their hands; and leaves his daughter to marry anybody she likes;
and they are all well pleased; and the Gifted as well as any of
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the middle of this little family party, gentlemen,
sits Tom all the while, as miserable as you like.&nbsp; But, when
everything else is arranged, the old gentleman&rsquo;s daughter
says, that their strange conduct was a little device of the
waiting-maid&rsquo;s to disgust the lovers he had chosen for
&rsquo;em, and will he forgive her? and if he will, perhaps he
might even find her a husband&mdash;and when she says that, she
looks uncommon hard at Tom.&nbsp; Then the waiting-maid says
that, oh dear! she couldn&rsquo;t abear Mr. Grig should think she
wanted him to marry her; and that she had even gone so far as to
refuse the last lamplighter, who was now a literary character
(having set up as a bill-sticker); and that she hoped Mr. Grig
would not suppose she was on her last legs by any means, for the
baker was very strong in his attentions at that moment, and as to
the butcher, he was frantic.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how
much more she might have said, gentlemen (for, as you know, this
kind of young women are rare ones to talk), if the old gentleman
hadn&rsquo;t cut in suddenly, and asked Tom if he&rsquo;d have
her, with ten pounds to recompense him for his loss of time and
disappointment, and as a kind of bribe to keep the story
secret.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t much matter, Sir,&rdquo; says
Tom, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t long for this world.&nbsp; Eight weeks
of marriage, especially with this young woman, might reconcile me
to my fate.&nbsp; I think,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I could go off
easy after that.&rdquo;&nbsp; With which he embraces her with a
very dismal face, and groans in a way that might move a heart of
stone&mdash;even of philosopher&rsquo;s stone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; says the old gentleman, &ldquo;that
reminds me&mdash;this bustle put it out of my head&mdash;there
was a figure wrong.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll live to a green old
age&mdash;eighty-seven at least!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How much, Sir?&rdquo; cries Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Eighty-seven!&rdquo; says the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without another word, Tom flings himself on the old
gentleman&rsquo;s neck; throws up his hat; cuts a caper; defies
the waiting-maid; and refers her to the butcher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t marry her!&rdquo; says the old
gentleman, angrily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And live after it!&rdquo; says Tom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner marry a mermaid with a small-tooth comb
and looking-glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then take the consequences,&rdquo; says the
other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With those words&mdash;I beg your kind attention here,
gentlemen, for it&rsquo;s worth your notice&mdash;the old
gentleman wetted the forefinger of his right hand in some of the
liquor from the crucible that was spilt on the floor, and drew a
small triangle on Tom&rsquo;s forehead.&nbsp; The room swam
before his eyes, and he found himself in the
watch-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Found himself <i>where</i>?&rsquo; cried the vice, on
behalf of the company generally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the watch-house,&rsquo; said the chairman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was late at night, and he found himself in the very
watch-house from which he had been let out that
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he go home?&rsquo; asked the vice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The watch-house people rather objected to that,&rsquo;
said the chairman; &lsquo;so he stopped there that night, and
went before the magistrate in the morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
you&rsquo;re here again, are you?&rdquo; says the magistrate,
adding insult to injury; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll trouble you for five
shillings more, if you can conveniently spare the
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tom told him he had been enchanted, but it
was of no use.&nbsp; He told the contractors the same, but they
wouldn&rsquo;t believe him.&nbsp; It was very hard upon him,
gentlemen, as he often said, for was it likely he&rsquo;d go and
invent such a tale?&nbsp; They shook their heads and told him
he&rsquo;d say anything but his prayers&mdash;as indeed he would;
there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.&nbsp; It was the only
imputation on his moral character that ever <i>I</i> heard
of.&rsquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
